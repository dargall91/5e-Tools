It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.\nThe possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the Dispel Evil and Good spell. When the possesion ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target iis immune to this ghost's possesion for 24 hours after succeeding on a saving throw or after the possesion ends."
