Acid: Ranged Weapon Attack:+4 to hit, range 5/20 ft, one target\nHit: 7 (2d6) Acid damage\n\n2. Alchemist's Fire: Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft, one target\nHit: 2 (1d4) Fire damage at the start of each of the target's turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.\n\n3. Basket of Centipedes: Throws the basket into a 5 ft square within 20 feet. A swarm of insects (centipedes) with 11 hit points emerges. At the end of the swarm's turn, it has a 50% chance to disperse.\n\n4. Green Slime Pot: Throws a clay pot of green slime. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft, one target\nHit: The target is covered in a patch of green slime (chapter 5 of DMG).\nMiss: A patch of green slime covers a randomly selected 5 foot section of wall or floor within 5 ft of the target\n\n5. Rot Grub Pot: Throws a clay pot into any space within 20 feet, which breaks on impact. A Swarm of Rot Grubs emerges and remains a hazard in that square.\n\n6. Scorpion on a Stick: Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target\nHit:1 Piercing damage and the target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.\n\n7. Skunk in a Cage: The Kobold releases a skunk into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The Skunk has a walking speed of 20 ft, 10 AC, 1 Hit Point, and no attacks. It rolls initiative, and, on its turn, uses its action to spray musk at a random creature within 5 feet of it. The target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target retches and can't take actions for one minute. The target can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a siccess. A creature that doesn't need to breath or is immune to poison automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Once the skunk has sprayed its musk, it can't do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.\n\n8. Wasp Nest in a Bag: Throws a small bag into a 5 foot space within 20 feet. A Swarm of Insects (wasps) with 11 Hit Points emerges. At the end of the swarm's turns, there is a 50% chance that it disperses."
