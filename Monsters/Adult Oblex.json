Cinstructs, oozes, plances, and undead succeed on the save automatically.\n\nWhile memory drained, the target must subtract 1d4 from all ability checks and attack rolls it makes. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the die size increases by one: (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20). When the die becomes a d20, the creature becomes unconcious for 1 hour.
